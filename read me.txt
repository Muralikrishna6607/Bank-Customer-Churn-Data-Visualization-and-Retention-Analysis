Bank Customer Churn Data Visualization and Retention Analysis
 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the banking and financial services industry. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes customer churn behavior using demographic, financial, and contract-related data. The goal is to identify key churn drivers and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.
 Objectives
* Analyze customer churn patterns
* Identify high-risk customer segments
* Evaluate the impact of contract types and payment methods
* Examine the relationship between tenure, monthly charges, and churn
* Provide strategic recommendations to reduce churn rate
 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level banking information with the following features:
Column NameDescriptionCustomerIDUnique customer identifierGenderMale / FemaleSeniorCitizen1 = Yes, 0 = NoTenureNumber of months the customer has stayedMonthlyChargesMonthly subscription chargesTotalChargesTotal amount charged to the customerContractContract type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)PaymentMethodPayment type (Mailed check, Electronic check, Bank transfer, Credit card)Churn1 = Customer churned, 0 = Retained
